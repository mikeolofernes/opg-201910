Thank you for having interest to be part of our team!.

Here at Flexisource, we are usually assigned by client a couple of data processing tasks from multiple sources such as database including data from files like XML.

To test your knowledge in .NET development, presented here is a new mvc dotnet core application. You are assigned to complete the solution based on the following specifications:

Each client has its own preferred file format and ordering of file processing.<br><br>
**Client A** requires the processing of the file based on the ff order: **shovel, waghor, blaze, discus**.<br>
**Client B** requires the processing of the file based on the ff order: **orca, widget, eclair, talon**.
